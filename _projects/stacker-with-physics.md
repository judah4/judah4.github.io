Indie Vs Gamers Jam [http://gamejolt.com/games/stacker-with-physics/80343](http://gamejolt.com/games/stacker-with-physics/80343)

 

Inspired by Tetris, this game gets chaotic as pieces fall around, bounce and twist in unusual ways.

I did a small 1 day prototype years ago and have been wanting to return to the concept and improve it. #indiesvsgamers game jam got me to start it new with better blocks and different physics materials. Pieces can be normal, ice, or rubber to make the physics based stacking even more fun.

Move Block - A D or ← →
Rotate - ↑ ↓
