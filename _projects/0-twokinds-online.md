What is it about a home that makes it feel so warm and cozy - Is it the fireplace cracking in the dim light, the placement of your favorite mug in a cabinet, or the people living within its corridors?
Moving into a new home can be exciting, but for little Song Li it was scary…
Explore a wholesome horror point and click adventure where you discover the secrets of Song Li’s new family home.

This one was a lot of fun to work on for Global Game Jam with everyone! I wasn't able to jam the whole time but contributing to this definitely scratched the game jam itch. I have not really jammed in the last few years but I think that will be changing soon.
