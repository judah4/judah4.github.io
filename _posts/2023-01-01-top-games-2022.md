# Tunic

This is such an amazing game. I really want to buy a physical version of the instruction booklet. The Dark Soulsy difficulty with the Legend of Zelda exploration is an amazing combination. The mysteries give this game so much depth and how many paths the designers hide in plain sight is shocking. I had a tough time deciding if Tunic or Elden Ring should be my game of the year, but Tunic won by being so charming. Plus foxes, I love foxes.

# Elden Ring

This released so early in the year. I haven't played it in a while now that I'm writing this. I love the Dark Souls series and From Software made an excellent open world game on par to affecting the genre like how Breath of the Wild did. Elden Ring was so close to winning game of the year but Tunic was too charming.

# Vampire Survivors

Game of the year for playing on Steamdeck! Vampire Survivors is so well designed and being the bullet hell is so fun. My favorite weapon so far is the garlic.

# Inscryption

I played most of this through 2021 but finally finished it 2022 on my Steam Deck. Vague spoilers but the first act was the the strongest gameplay part.

# Final Fantasy XIV : Endwalker

I need to make another screenshot... Now that we are between expansions, I've been playing less. I've never been caught up for content in an MMO before and it feels nice. The latest patches include the Island you can build up which I enjoy a lot. My WoL is on a much needed vacation.

# Cyberpunk 2077

Edgerunners the anime was so awesome I finally got around to trying the game. Turns out, the game is good after a year of bug fixes. It's not the best game ever made but the Tabletop RPG roots for the game give the world a nice depth to it. I want more stories in Night City.

# The Steamdeck!!

Truly the year of linux on the desktop! This device has unlocked so much of my Steam library for playing on the couch. It is 100% why I completed 6+ games in 2022.

## Honorable Mentions

1. Portal 2
1. Destiny 2
1. Pokemon Violet

# Portal 2

The writing still holds up. 10/10.

# Destiny 2

Look, I'm playing Destiny again! Honestly I think I like Halo Infinite Multiplayer more but all my friends are playing Destiny again so I am too. It's interesting thinking about how much time I've put into Destiny over the years. We just recently beat Vault of Glass, now that it's in Destiny 2, and I feel like it's 2014 again. I'm also surprised Destiny that Destiny was only 3 years old when Destiny 2 released. It probably should have been the live service platform Destiny 2 is now and I'm expecting Destiny 2 to rebrand and drop the 2 at some point.

# Pokemon Violet
Such a fun buggy mess. I earned all 8 gym badges right before the end of the year. It's... a mess. But, a fun mess. Only Pokemon I can put 20 hours into it in a week and still want to play it. At the time of this writing, I have only 50 more Pokemon to catch to complete my pokedex. A very solid 7/10 game.
