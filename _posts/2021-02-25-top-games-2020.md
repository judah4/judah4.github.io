Wow, what a year. Looking back, I didn't play too many new games, or at least games that stood out to me as my game of the year. I played Among Us and Fall Guys and while they were good, they were not my best. Heck, I could add Hades again to my top games.

Not sure why but this article is taking me forever to write, all the way until February. Here's to writing more in the new year.

Anyways, here are my top games I played last year.

I really shouldn't play Factorio but this scratches that same itch. I played Satisfactory early in 2020, in the before times, and loved it.
Making conveyor belts cover the map is so satisfying. I was not organized, or did much planning so the conveyor belts went everywhere and the stacks grew higher and higher. My factory is opened wall, multiple stories, and a hot mess.

## Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 Remaster

I didn't know now much nostalgia I had for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater until I played the remake and, wow, it's good. I hope they add THPS 3 maps to it eventually.

## Animal Crossing

Animal Crossing made April bearable. I stopped after a few months but was a good escape. My wife and I both had our own islands and different fruit so we starting exchanging as soon as we could.

##  Final Fantasy XIV

Just completed Heavensward. Dragons üêâüíñ

I've been playing off and on for years and is my current MMORPG of choice. Can't wait to get to Shadowbringers!

These last few months I've been expanding my classes so I can now tank with Dark Knight at level 51. I'm having a tough time deciding on a main DPS class since there are so many. I do like Dragoon, you know, because of dragons.

## MTG Arena

![Mtg Arena](/assets/img/posts/top2020/mtgarena.PNG){: .image-sized .center-image } 

Way cheaper than physical card Magic: The Gathering. I made a pretty fun Standard Dimir Rogue Mill Deck and made it up the ranks pretty far. The ranks are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Mythic, resetting monthly. I made it up to Diamond in December which was pretty nice. I didn't think I was that good at Magic but MTG Arena makes it really easy to play and adjust. I don't know how much play time I put into this game but it's probably my top played. Just one more match.
