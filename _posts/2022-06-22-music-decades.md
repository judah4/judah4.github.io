Not sure if there are actual decade names for music but I’m making up my own! I personally like to name and classify things so this is an inane exercise to make me feel old.

# The Names
* The Before Times  
* Classic 70s  
* Old Skool 80s  
* Nostalgic 90s  
* Throwback 00s  

Being born in the 90s, I can't come up with any other name for them other than Nostalgic. Coming up with a name for the 80s is tough, but Old Skool feels right. The 2000s are old, but not too old, so Throwback feels appropriate. We just left the 10s, so I don’t have a name for them yet and anything before is the before times.
