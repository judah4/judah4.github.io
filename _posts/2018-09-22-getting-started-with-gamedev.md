Hello! I've been doing game development for while now and people have asked how do you start. 
There are many ways to get into game development so here is my advice to learn to program video games.

First off, if you are brand new to programming, I highly suggest [Chris DeLeon's](https://twitter.com/ChrisDeLeon) free code your first game udemy course found at [code-your-first-game.com](http://code-your-first-game.com).
It is well structured and will walk you though making a breakout game with javascript that can be played in your browser right away.

I personally use Unity3d for making games. There are many engines out there and a lot of them are good but I prefer using unity.
If you want to make games, do not make your own engine. You will spend all your time making an engine and not a game. Of course, making an engine is a great learning experience but don't expect to get anything done soon with it. 
Make a game engine if you want to learn, make a game with an existing engine if you want to make a game.


### Here is a list of some popular engines.  
[Unity3d](https://unity3d.com/) - My engine of choice, a good general purpose engine. Program with C# and has visual scripting packages in the giant Unity Asset Store.  

[Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) - Probably the best looking out of the box free game engine. Code in C++ or Blueprints, their visual scripting interface.

[Game Maker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) - A great and easy to use 2D engine. If you want to make 2d games, focus on an engine that specifically does 2D instead of a generalized one.

There are many more engines I might try to cover some time but these are some of the bigger ones you might want to try. The rest of the resources here are going to be for Unity3d.

#### Online Tutorials

A good place to start using unity is to check out the [learn section](https://unity3d.com/learn) and [tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials). 
The classic starting tutorial is the [Roll-a-ball tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial).
There are also the [2D Game Kit](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-kit) and [3D Game Kit](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/3d-game-kit) with a lot of game ready assets to use.

#### Video Tutorials

Brakeys has a great [learning unity tutorial](https://youtu.be/IlKaB1etrik) and other goodies on his channel found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA).
Once you have the basics, he has an [rpg tutorial](https://youtu.be/nu5nyrB9U_o) ran in parallel with [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmtyQOKKmrMVaKuRXz02jbQ) making [3d assets](https://youtu.be/NGn_gSfYwVw).
