Hello! I'm Judah and I'm rebranding my personal blog to [www.inconsistent.software](https://www.inconsistent.software).

I've owned this domain for a long time and have always wanted to get into more technical writing, but my writing and open source contributions have always been haphazard and inconsistent, so I figured it's time to use the url. I'm currently writing about my networking experience with [DragonGF](https://github.com/judah4/MMO-Dragon-Game-Framwork) and hope to write more. We will see. I should also write about how I feel about Hacktoberfest.

Anyways,  
My game stuff is [here](https://www.cookiedragon.games) and my GitHub stuff is [here](https://github.com/judah4).
