{% include post-styling.md %}

# The List

1. Death's Door
1. DELTARUNE Chapter 2
1. Final Fantasy XIV (Again)
1. MTG Arena (Again)

# Thoughts

## Death's Door

Death's Door blew me away. The characters are charming and the gameplay has good depth. I wouldn't exactly call it a Zeldalike but it was definitely in the style of Link to the Past or Link's Awakening. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good Hack n Slash.

## DELTARUNE Chapter 2

Honestly surprised this dropped last year. It was amazing and the soundtrack was real good too. I don't think it wows me as much as Undertale did but the episodic nature should give it a real satisfying end if they do it right.

##  Final Fantasy XIV : Endwalker

This shouldn't be a surprise. My wife and I finished Shadowbringers last year and were super hyped for Endwalker and it delivered. The culmination of the the stories they've been building for years where done extraordinarily well. I'm not sure how they are going to top it. 
Post story, I've been slowly leveling up characters and drifting away to other games. At the time I am writing this, the 6.1 patch dropped and it pulled me back almost immediately. It's such a good game.

## MTG Arena

I play this more than I should. Favorite color is Blue. I've been a playing a lot more Commander lately so my time on MTG Arena has gone down.
