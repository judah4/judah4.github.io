# Thoughts

## Elden Ring

This released so early in the year now that I'm writing this I haven't played it in a while. I love the Dark Souls series and From Software made an excellent open world game on par to affecting the genre like how Breath of the Wild did.

## Tunic

This might actually be the top. I really want to buy a physical version of the instruction booklet.

## Inscryption

I played most of this through 2021 but finally finished it 2021 on my Steam Deck.

##  Final Fantasy XIV : Endwalker

I need to make another screenshot... Now that we are between expansions I've been playing less. I've never been caught up for content in an MMO before and it feels nice. The latest patches include the Island you can build up which I enjoy a lot.  

# Destiny 2

Look, I'm playing Destiny again! Honestly I think I like Halo Infinite Multiplayer more but all my friends are playing Destiny again so I am too. It's interesting thinking about how much time I've put into Destiny over the years. We just recently beat Vault of Glass, now that it's in Destiny 2, and I feel like it's 2014 again. I'm also surprised Destiny that Destiny was only 3 years old when Destiny 2 released. It probably should have been the live service platform Destiny 2 is now and I'm expecting Destiny 2 to rebrand and drop the 2 at some point.
