Back in 2014, when the [Unity UI](https://blog.unity.com/technology/overview-of-the-new-ui-system) was new, I had an idea to make a color picker to use in game using the new UI system. Thus, [HSV Color Picker](https://github.com/judah4/HSV-Color-Picker-Unity) was created. Now, nearly 9 years later (yikes!), the library has reached 500+ stars on GitHub! 
It's wild to me that potentially that many people are using code I wrote in their games.

## Why I made it

When the new UI system came out, I was excited. The old system worked but had a lot of limitations and very programmer centric. The new system looked great with it's wysiwyg editing that aligned more with Unity's visual editor and component system approach.
I was thinking about character creation and how players should be able to change the color of their hair or cloths, and there wasn't much around for doing that. I think at that time I was also learning about some color theory and how Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) was calcuated. 
I **also** wanted to contribute to open source so everything aligned and I started the color picker project as an open sourced licensed project.
My main goal was to make something I can use for my game but with the secondary goal of making a nice UI component other people can use.
