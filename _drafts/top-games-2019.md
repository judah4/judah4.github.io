## Thoughts

### [Dicey Dungeons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/)

Ever since last year, I've been more into chiptune. 
This game has a great soundtrack from Chipzel which is what first drew me into the game. 
The dungeon diving with dice is a lot of fun, 
and each character adds their own changes to the gameplay so it takes a long time for me to become bored.
The music, the art, the gameplay all make for a very fun game that I highly recommend.

### [Manifold Garden](https://manifold.garden/)

I've been following the development of this game for years and it's finally out!
This game looks crazy good and inverting the world for the first time was amazing. 
This is the M. C. Escher stairs in video game form and it is fun.
Puzzles mixing non-euclidean space and water flows were my personal favorites.

### Pokemon Sword

I think I haven't finished a Pokemon game since Generation 4. I fell off the end of Gen 6 and somewhere in the middle of Gen 7.
I finished Sword in about 27 hours and I had a great time playing it. 
The wilderness area is a really good addition for the game and is now where I spend most of my post-game time.

As someone who never finishes Pokemon games, I'm fine with the missing national pokedex. 
I am sad I can't import my Lycanroc from Pokemon Sun, but the new regional pokemon have captured my heart and mind.

### Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy

This was my first time playing Phoenix Wright and it makes me wish I played it years ago!
The characters are great, the courtroom drama is tense, and I always feel like I'm winning cases by a hair.
I still have more to play but it's definitely one of the best games I played this year.

### [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/)

Hades brings the tradition of being a super game from Supergiant Games. 
The characters, gameplay, and music make this an amazing game to play.
