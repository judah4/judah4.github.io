## Thoughts

### Dicey Dungeons
Ever since last year, I've been more into chiptune. 
This game has a great soundtrack from Chipzel which is what first drew me into the game. 
The dungeon diving with dice is a lot of fun, 
and each character adds their own changes to the gameplay so it takes a long time for me to become bored.
The music, the art, the gameplay all make for a very fun game that I highly recommend.

### Manifold Garden
I've been following the development of this game for years and it's finally out!
