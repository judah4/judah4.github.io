//Do I want to furry brand my blog?

I tell myself each year I should write more and this might be the year to do it! I'm inspired by [Soatok's post Something To Always Keep In Mind](https://soatok.blog/2023/04/05/something-to-always-keep-in-mind/) to write down my thoughts on what I want my blog to be.

## Blogging

I've always had trouble deciding on my writing voice. I like to write! But, I usually feel very self concious about it and I never feel like wanting to share it. Now that blogs are on the rise again, I might as well try posting something about once a month.
[Gabriel's blog](https://blog.gabrielsimmer.com) is another source of inspiration to write more. Check out his post about [Using RSS](https://blog.gabrielsimmer.com/posts/use-rss/).
I've been using Jekyll for a while since it was really easy to set up on GitHub pages though I've since moved it over to Netlify. I wonder every once in a while if I want to switch to some other system since i'm not really a big Ruby fan. I guess I should check out other static website generators like Hugo.

## Furry Identity

I consider myself a furry. I have a dragon fursona I originally called The Cookie Dragon and eventually gave the name Foxis.
I maintain my own image reference website for him using Vue at [ref.cookiedragons.com](https://ref.cookiedragons.com/dragon).

Do I want to inline character dialog? I'm not sure. I already write in my own voice. I think my of my dragon as a part of me but not something with it's own voice seperate from me. Plus, I don't think I want to mess with templates and css to get a whole character dialog system working.

> Rwarr!!

I do like using emotes so I might figure out something with that.
[Xe's Blog](https://xeiaso.net/blog) is probably the best example of using characters in blogs but also a crazy amount of engineering to [make it look good](https://xeiaso.net/blog/site-update-better-css).
