## Thoughts

These are my top games for both video games and board games. A lot of these are formative and foundation for the genres I like and who I am. 
I have a few more games that didn't make the cut [at {%link stuff/topgames.md %}]({%link stuff/topgames.md %}).
I know I forgot some games so I'll be updating the page every once in a while.

Here are some games I want to highlight and write about.

### Undertale 
Undertale is my number one game. I played it at the right time for it resonant and stays with me to this day. I like Deltarune but it's hard to live up to the original.

### Final Fantasy XIV
Final Fantasy XIV is my most played game. Shadowbringers has an amazing story and I play it a lot with friends and family. It is my favorite current MMO.

### Elden Ring / Dark Souls

I've never actually finished Dark Souls 1 but it is so important to me for the style of games I enjoy. I did complete Dark Souls 2 as a Dual-wielding swordsman. Elden Ring was of course amazing mixing soulsborn gameplay with great open world design.

### Mabinogi

My all time favorite MMO. I played this so much in high school. I loved the skill based stat system. Runescape may have been why I feel in love with MMORPGs but Mabinogi is what deepened my interest and why I love virtual worlds.

### Dark Cloud 2

AAAAAAAAAHH. This game does so much and it is amazing. It has enough game systems to rival an MMORPG.

### Magic: The Gathering

I spend too much on the card game but I enjoy player Edh/Commander.

### Mass Effect

I annoyed my brother so much by listening to the audio codexes.
