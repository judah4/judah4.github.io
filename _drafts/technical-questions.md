How do do you answer questions during meeting? Here's my process for questions I have domain knowledge on to questions I have no idea how to answer.

## There are 3 kinds of questions:

### You know 100%, your domain knowledge, give that expert response.

Sometimes you are the expert! Make sure to answer confidently.

### Something you know that is plausible but not 100% sure. Answer the parts you do know, theorize other parts you can with disclaimers, and tell them you need to follow up once you can check for sure.


### No idea, who's the expert to ask about this.


When possible, a little bit of research and notes before meetings goes a long way. I'm personally not a good note taker but even my meager notes help me remember what needs to be brought up during meetings.
