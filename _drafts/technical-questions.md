title:  "How to Answer Questions During a Meeting"
categories: work

How do do you answer questions during meeting? Here' my process for questions I have domain knowledge on to questions I have no idea how to answer.

There are 3 kinds of questions:

1. You know 100%, your domain knowledge, give that expert response
1. Something you know that is plausible but not 100% sure. Answer the parts you do know, theorize other parts you can with disclaimers, and tell them you need to follow up once you can check for sure
1. No idea, who's the expert to ask about this

Little bit of research and notes before meetings (I'm not a good note taker, still working on that)
