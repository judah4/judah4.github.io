My top games this year. Not necessarily when they were released but when I played them. Looking at you DOOM. 
I listen to a lot of music and game soundtracks so my ratings will also include how often I listen to the music.

## The List

0. Just Shapes & Beats
1. DELTARUNE
1. Ni no Kuni II
1. DOOM (2016)
1. Assassin's Creed Odyssey
1. Nintendo (Splatoon 2, BotW, Pokemon Let's go)

## Thoughts

### [Just Shapes & Beats](http://www.justshapesandbeats.com/)
* Soundtrack: Weekly listening.

This one actually surprised me. I was looking forward to playing this one for a while ever since I found the website (http://www.justshapesandbeats.com/).
Initially I wasn't big on the music since it's not normally my style but now I mix in songs from the soundtrack nearly daily.



### [DELTARUNE](https://www.deltarune.com/)
* Soundtrack: Daily listening.

DELTARUNE, the Undertale sequel/prequel/spin-off from Toby Fox. Speaking of music, Deltarune is now on my daily music listening along side the Undertale music.

The story was fun, the characters are great. When I finished playing Undertale I really wanted more and now Deltarune scratches that itch. 
I really hope Toby Fox continues it.

### DOOM (2016)
* Soundtrack : Monthly listening.  

Finally got around to playing this after 2 years. Looking forward to DOOM Eternal whenever that comes out. I also listen to this soundtrack every once in a while. 
I really like music.



### Ni no Kuni II
* Soundtrack: Good 

Almost forgot this came out this year! Wow, has it been a long year. I really love the art style and Studio Ghibli influence.



### Nintendo Games
* Soundtrack: Good 

Played BotW finally and loved it. Played Splatoon 2 and it was excellent. Still in the middle of Pokemon Let's go Eevee. 
I never actually played through Red and Blue so finally doing so in a spin off is pretty fun.



### Assassins Creed Odyssey
* Soundtrack: Ambient, what soundtrack? 

I haven't played an AC game since Black Flag and felt like playing again since I heard Origins was pretty good. 
I like the combat changes but it definitely feels like Assassin's Creed.
