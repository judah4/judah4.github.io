My previous laptop's battery was dying so I was looking for a new laptop, and [Framework](https://frame.work/) caught my eye. 
I've never been afraid to take apart and swap out drives in my previous laptops I was really excited about getting one that was built for swapping out parts.

I've had my Framework 13 for a few months now and I love it. The newly announced gaming series look nice but I like how small and thin this thing is.
The battery life is good, it wasn't that hard to put together and being able to pick what ports you have on it are so nice. I'm writing this blog post in my Framework! I had one issue actually. When I was putting it together for the first time, I thought I plugged the keyboard connecter in all the but it came loose. I went to turn it on for the first time and nothing happened. I was afraid it was a dud but I saw the issue when I reopened it. Once I verified the keyboard was connected properly, it booted right up with no issues.

10/10 would recommend.

Okay, maybe another thing that bugs me is the screen resolution and aspect ratio. It's 3:2. It taller than the usual 16:9, which is nice, but games like FF14 have a hard time setting the resolution to it properly without it squashing or stretching. It takes some fiddling I guess. It is a nice screen though, and the taller resolution makes writing this really nice.
