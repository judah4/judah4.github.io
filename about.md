I am a software developer with 5+ years of professional experience. I do a lot of work with warehousing systems and e-commerce REST API connections. My preferred language is C#. 
I also have years of experience working with Unity3d making video games.

My game development can be found at [Cookie Dragon Games](http://www.cookiedragon.games)
