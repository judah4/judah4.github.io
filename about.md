# Judah Perez (he/him)

I am a software developer with 8+ years of professional experience. I did a lot of work with warehousing systems and e-commerce REST API connections. I was previously working on an indie MMO using Unity3d and am now working full time on video games. My preferred programming language is C#. I like dragons. 

My previous indie game development can be found at [Cookie Dragon Games](https://www.cookiedragon.games)
